"Many applications require quantifying the landuse patterns in a region. Land"
" Use Land Cover (LULC) datasets come as raster files where each pixel is "
"assigned a class value. GIS analysts often needs to generate reports based "
"on this data by computing the area per class in a given region. QGIS comes "
"with many built-in tools to calculate and summarize raster area."

"Historically the suggested approach for calculating areas for rasters was to"
" convert the raster to a vector layer and use vector area calculation "
"techniques. This approach is quite computationally intensive and error-"
"prone. The recommended approach is to use the processing tool **Raster layer"
" unique values report** which can directly compute the pixel areas. If you "
"have a layer with many polygons and need areas for each of them, you can use"
" the **Zonal histogram** tool to get pixel counts for each class and then "
"multiply it with the area of each pixel."
