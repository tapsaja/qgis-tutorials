"Time is an important component of many spatial datasets. Along with location"
" information, time providers another dimension for analysis and "
"visualization of data. If you are working with dataset that contains "
"timestamps or have observations recorded at multiple time-steps, you can "
"easily visualize it using the **TimeManager** plugin in QGIS. TimeManager "
"allows you to view and export 'slices' of data between certain time "
"intervals that can be combined into animations."
