"Tiles have revolutionized the idea of web mapping and has given us fast and "
"easy access to large datasets. Tiling schemes divide the world into small "
"tiles (typically 256 x 256 pixels) for each zoom level and pre-render "
"datasets to these tiles. This way only a small fraction of a large dataset "
"is served to the user at any given time - resulting in a map that can be "
"zoomed or panned with ease over the internet. There are many methods to "
"create tiles from GIS datasets. One easy way to create tiles from your QGIS "
"project is a plugin called **QTiles**. In this tutorial, you will learn how "
"to create PNG tiles from any set of layers loaded in QGIS and create a "
"basemap to be used in a web mapping project."
