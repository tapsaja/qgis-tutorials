"Web mapping is a great medium to publish your GIS data to the web and make "
"it accessible to other users. Creating a web map is a very different process"
" than creating one in a GIS. GIS users are typically aren’t web programmers "
"and it presents a challenge when one needs to create a web map that is of "
"the same quality as a map creating in a GIS. Fortunately, there are tools "
"available to easily translate your work in QGIS to web maps. In this "
"tutorial, you will learn how to use the **QGIS2Web** plugin to create a web "
"map using OpenLayers or Leaflet libraries from your QGIS project."

" carte Web est un processus très différent de la création d'une carte dans "
"un SIG. Les utilisateurs de SIG ne sont généralement pas des programmeurs "
"Web et il est difficile de créer une carte Web de la même qualité qu'une "
"carte créée dans un SIG. Heureusement, il existe des outils disponibles pour"
" traduire facilement votre travail dans QGIS en cartes Web. Dans ce "
