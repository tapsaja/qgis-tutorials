"Map projections - or Coordinate Reference System (CRS) - often cause a lot "
"of frustration when working with GIS data.  But a proper understanding of "
"the concepts and access to the right tools will make it much easier to deal "
"with projections. In this tutorial, we will explore how projections work in "
"QGIS and learn about tools available for vector and rasters data layers."

"Now let's see how we can change the layer's projection. This operation is "

"A new layer ``united_kingdom`` will appear on the :guilabel:`Layer Panel`. "

"layer's CRS doesn't match the Project CRS, it will automatically be "
"transformed to the Project CRS so it can be displayed correctly. Now let's "
"set the Project CRS to match the newly created ``united_kingdom`` Layer's "
