"Spatial queries are core to many types of GIS analysis. Spatial queries "
"allows you to select features in a layer by their spatial relationships "
"(intersect, contain, touch etc.) with features from another layer. In QGIS, "
"this functionality is available via the **Select by Location** and **Extract"
" by Location** Processing tools."
