"In the tutorial :doc:`georeferencing_basics`, we covered the basic "
"georeferencing process in QGIS. That method involved reading the coordinates"
" from your scanned map and entering them manually as control points. Many "
"times though, you may not have the coordinates printed on your map, or you "
"are trying to georeference an image. In that case, you can use another "
"georeferenced data source as your input. This tutorial will teach you how to"
" use existing open data sources in your georeferencing process."

"În tutorialul :doc:`georeferencing_basics` s-a discutat despre procesul de "
"bază al georeferențierii în QGIS. Această metodă implică citirea "
"coordonatelor hărții scanate și introducerea lor manuală ca puncte de "
"control. De multe ori, coordonatele nu sunt imprimate pe hartă, sau pe "
"imaginea pe care încercați să o georeferențiați. În acest caz, puteți "
"utiliza ca intrare o altă sursă de date georeferențiate. În acest tutorial, "
"veți învăța cum să folosiți în procesul de georeferențiere sursele de date "
"aflate în domeniul public."

"We will use a basemap from OpenStreetMap to capture the coordinates for "
"georeferencing. QGIS3 comes with  built-in support for tile layers. These "
"are commonly known as 'XYZ' layers since they are made using individual map "
"tiles for each zoom level (z) on a x,y coordinate grid. You can find the "
"``OpenStreetMap`` layer under :guilabel:`XYZ Tiles` in the "
":guilabel:`Browser Panel`. Drag the layer to the main canvas. Once loaded, "
"note the Coordinate Reference System (CRS) for this layer in the bottom-"
"right corder. It is set as ``EPSG 3857 Pseudo Mercator``. This is important "
"because the coordinates we infer from this layer during georeferencing will "
"be in this CRS."
