"Plugins in QGIS add useful features to the software. Plugins are written by "
"QGIS developers and other independent developers who want to extend the core"
" functionality of the software. These plugins are then uploaded to the QGIS "
"Plugin Repository, reviewed by the community members, and then made "
"available to all QGIS users."

"Let's enable one of the plugins. Check on the checkbox next to "

"items at various locations and create new panels and toolbars. Sometimes it "
"is difficult to know how to find the newly enabled tools. One clue is to "
"look in the plugin description. Here the description says *Category: "
"Vector*. That indicates that the plugin would be found under the "
":guilabel:`Vector` menu once enabled. Also, these plugins cannot be "
