"The *Processing Framework* in QGIS provides an environment within QGIS to "
"run native and third-party algorithms for processing data. It contains a "
"nice batch processing interface that allows one to execute an algorithm on "
"several layers easily. Batch processing is a useful tool that can save "
"manual effort and help you automate repetitive tasks."
