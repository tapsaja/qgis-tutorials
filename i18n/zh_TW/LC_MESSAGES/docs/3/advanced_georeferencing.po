"In the tutorial :doc:`georeferencing_basics` we covered the basic process of"
" georeferencing in QGIS. That method involved reading the coordinates from "
"your scanned map and entering them manually as control points. Many times "
"though you may not have the coordinates printed on your map, or you are "
"trying to georeference an image. In that case, you can use another "
"georeferenced data-source as your input. In this tutorial, you will learn "
"how to use existing open data sources in your georeferencing process."

"We will use a basemap from OpenStreetMap to capture the coordinates for "
"georeferencing. QGIS3 comes with  built-in support for tile layers. These "
"are commonly known as 'XYZ' layers since they are made using individual map "
"tiles for each zoom level (z) on a x,y coordinate grid. You can find the "
"``OpenStreetMap`` layer under :guilabel:`XYZ Tiles` in the "
":guilabel:`Browser Panel`. Drag the layer to the main canvas. Once loaded, "
"note the Coordinate Reference System (CRS) for this layer in the bottom-"
"right corder. It is set as ``EPSG 3857 Pseudo Mercator``. This is important "
"because the coordinates we infer from this layer during georeferencing will "
