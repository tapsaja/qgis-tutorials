"If your organization publishes printed or online maps, you often would need "
"to create many maps with the same template - usually one for each "
"administrative unit or a region of interest. Creating these maps manually "
"can take a long time and if you want to update these on a regular basis, it "
"can turn into a chore. QGIS has a tool called ``Atlas`` that can help you "
"create a map template and easily publish a large number of maps for "
"different geographic regions. If you are not familiar with the basics of "
"Print Layout, please go through the :doc:`../making_a_map` tutorial."
