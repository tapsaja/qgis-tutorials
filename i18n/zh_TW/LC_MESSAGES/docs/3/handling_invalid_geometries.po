"When working with vector data layers, you may encounter geometry errors. "
"These errors often become part of your data after running geoprocessing, "
"digitizing, editing or data conversion. QGIS3 comes with build-in tools and "
"algorithms to detect and fix invalid geometries. This tutorial will show you"
" a typical workflow for handling invalid geometries in your data."

"Different software systems implement different notions of geometry validity."
" But the leading standard for the geometry model for use in a GIS is the OGC"
" `Simple Features Specifications (SFS) "
"<https://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/sfs>`_. In this tutorial, we will "
"use GEOS library to check for geometry validity which uses this standard. "
"`This post <https://knowledge.safe.com/articles/21674/invalid-ogc-geometry-"
"examples.html>`_ gives a good overview of common geometry errors as defined "
"by the OGC standard."

"The *Topological coloring* algorithm implements an algorithm to color a map "
