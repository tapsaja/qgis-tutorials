"Historically the suggested approach for calculating areas for rasters was"
" to convert the raster to a vector layer and use vector area calculation "
"techniques. This approach is quite computationally intensive and error-"
"prone. The recommended approach is to use the processing tool **Raster "
"layer unique values report** which can directly compute the pixel areas. "
"If you have a layer with many polygons and need areas for each of them, "
"you can use the **Zonal histogram** tool to get pixel counts for each "
"class and then multiply it with the area of each pixel."
