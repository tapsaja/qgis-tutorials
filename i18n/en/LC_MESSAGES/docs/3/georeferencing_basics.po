"Most GIS projects require georeferencing some raster data. "
"*Georeferencing* is the process of assigning real-world coordinates to "
"each pixel of the raster. Many times these coordinates are obtained by "
"doing field surveys - collecting coordinates with a GPS device for few "
"easily identifiable features in the image or map. In some cases, where "
"you are looking to digitize scanned maps, you can obtain the coordinates "
"from the markings on the map image itself. Using these sample coordinates"
" or GCPs ( Ground Control Points ), the image is warped and made to fit "
"within the chosen coordinate system. In this tutorial I will discuss the "
"concepts, strategies and tools within QGIS to achieve a high accuracy "
"georeferencing."
