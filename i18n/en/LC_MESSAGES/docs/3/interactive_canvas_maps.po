"1. We will start by creating a grid. To make our grid with global "
"extents, we can load the world map on the canvas. You can type ``world`` "
"in the coordinates box at the bottom of the QGIS window and press "
":guilabel:`Enter`. This is one of the several hidden *easter eggs* in "
"QGIS. You can discover other easter eggs on our `YouTube Channel "
