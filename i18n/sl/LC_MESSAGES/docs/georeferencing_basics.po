"Most GIS projects require georeferencing some raster data. *Georeferencing* "
"is the process of assigning real-world coordinates to each pixel of the "
"raster. Many times these coordinates are obtained by doing field surveys - "
"collecting coordinates with a GPS device for few easily identifiable "
"features in the image or map. In some cases, where you are looking to "
"digitize scanned maps, you can obtain the coordinates from the markings on "
"the map image itself. Using these sample coordinates or GCPs ( Ground "
"Control Points ), the image is warped and made to fit within the chosen "
"coordinate system. In this tutorial I will discuss the concepts, strategies "
"and tools within QGIS to achieve a high accuracy georeferencing."

"1.Georeferencing in QGIS is done via the ‘Georeferencer GDAL’ plugin. This "
"is a core plugin - meaning it is already part of your QGIS installation. You"
" just need to enable it. Go to :menuselection:`Plugins --> Manage and "
"Install Plugins` and enable the :guilabel:`Georeferencer GDAL` plugin in the"
" :guilabel:`Installed` tab. See :doc:`using_plugins` for more details on how"
" to work with plugins."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/georeferencing_basics.rst:62

"The plugin is installed in the Raster menu. Click on :menuselection:`Raster "
"--> Georeferencer --> Georeferencer` to open the plugin."
msgstr ""

"The plugin window is divided into 2 sections. The top section where the "
"raster will be displayed and the bottom section where a table showing your "
"GCPs will appear."

msgid ""
"Now we will open our JPG image. Go to :menuselection:`File --> Open Raster`."
" Browse to the downloaded image of the scanned map and click "
":guilabel:`Open`."

"In the next screen, you will asked to choose the raster’s coordinate "
"reference system (CRS). This is to specify the projection and datum of your "
"control points. If you have collected the ground control points using a GPS "
"device, you would have the WGS84 CRS. If you are geo-referencing a scanned "
"map like this, you can obtain the CRS information from the map itself. "
"Looking at our map image, the coordinates are in Lat/Long. There is no datum"
" information given, so we have to assume an appropriate one. Since it is "
"India and the map is quite old, we can bet the Everest 1830 datum would give"
" us good results."
