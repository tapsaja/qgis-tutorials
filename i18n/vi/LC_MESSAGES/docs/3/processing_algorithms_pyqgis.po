"The Processing Toolbox in QGIS contain an ever-growing collection of "
"geoprocessing tools. The toolbox provides an easy batch processing interface"
" to run any algorithm on a large number of inputs. See "
":doc:`batch_processing`. But there are cases where you need to incorporate a"
" little bit of custom logic in your batch processing. As all the processing "
"algorithms can be run programmatically via the Python API, you can run them "
"via the Python Console. This tutorial shows how to run a processing "
"algorithm via the Python Console to perform a custom geoprocessing task in "
"just a few lines of code. Please review the "
":doc:`getting_started_with_pyqgis` tutorial to get familiar with the basics "
"of the Python Scripting environment in QGIS."

"month, it will be useful to specify a custom prefix with the month number so"
" we can easily identify the mean values for each month (i.e. 01_mean, "
"02_mean etc.). Specifying this custom prefix is not possible in the Batch "
"Processing interface of QGIS and if we ran this command using that "
"interface, we would have to manually enter the custom prefix for each layer."
" If you are working with a large number of layers, this can be very "
