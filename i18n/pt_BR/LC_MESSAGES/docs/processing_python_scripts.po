"One can write standalone pyqgis scripts that can be run via the Python "
"Console in QGIS. With a few tweaks, you can make your standalone scripts run"
" via the Processing Framework. This has several advantages. First, taking "
"user input and writing output files is far easier because Processing "
"Framework offers standardized user interface for these. Second, having your "
"script in the Processing Toolbox also allows it to be part of any Processing"
" Model or be run as a Batch job with multiple inputs. This tutorial will "
"show how to write a custom python script that can be part of the Processing "
"Framework in QGIS."

"Our script will perform a dissolve operation based on a field chosen by the "

"population in the dissolved region."
