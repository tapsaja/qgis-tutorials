"Creating, visualizing, and managing networks is an important part of GIS. "
"Many types of physical infrastructure such as roads, railways, utilities can"
" be modeled as networks with lines and nodes - with properties attached to "
"them. In this tutorial, we will learn how road networks are commonly modeled"
" and apply some styling techniques to visualize the routing properties. We "
"will also use QGIS3's built-in tools for network analysis that to find "
"shortest path between 2 points along the network."

"Select the :guilabel:`Identify` tool in the :guilabel:`Attributes Toolbar`. "
"Click on any road segment to see what attributes are attached to it. There "
"are standard attributes like road name, type etc. there is an attribute "
"called ``DIRECTIONA``. This is an import attribute for routing as it "
"specifies whether the segment is two-way or one-way. It contains 4 different"
" values. ``Two Way`` for two-way streets. ``One Way (Digitizing direction)``"
" for one-way streets where the traffic is allowed in the direction of the "
"line (start-point to end-point) and ``One way (Against digitizing "
"direction)`` for one-way streets where the traffic flows in the opposite "
"direction of the line. There is also ``Unknown`` value where we will assume "
"two-way traffic. We will now use the information in that attribute to "

"We can put a conditional expression that returns different rotation value "

"You will see that there are many possible paths between start and end "

"result is the shortest possible path. It is always a good idea to validate "
"your analysis and assumptions. One easy way to validate it is to use a "
"third-party mapping service to see if their results match with the ones we "
"derived. Here is the shortest path `suggested by Google Maps "
"<https://goo.gl/maps/XwTXTkvuaCuteocr8>`_ between the same start and end "
"points. As you can see the recommended shortest route matches exactly with "
"our results - validating our analysis."
