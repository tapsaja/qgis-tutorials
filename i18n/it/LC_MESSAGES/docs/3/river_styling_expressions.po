"In the previous tutorial `Creating a Block World Map (QGIS3) "
"<https://www.qgistutorials.com/en/docs/3/block_world_styling.html>`_ we used"
" expressions for scaling values and apply a color ramp. We build on those "
"concepts and learn how to use expressions to visualize rivers in a popular "
"style."
